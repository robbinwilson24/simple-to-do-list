## Program Description <a name="program-description"/>
A simple to-to do list that I created using React-Redux and CSS. 
Allowing the user to add tasks, delete tasks and mark tasks as complete.

It is fairly straight forward:

- **To edit an existing item on the to do list:** Click "Edit" in the relevant item and change it's details via the onscreen prompt.
- **To delete an item from the list:** Click delete on the relevant item. 
- **To mark an item as complete:** Simply click the "Done" button on the relevant item line.

5. Once this has finished installing, you can start the game by running the following  in the command line - **"npm start"**.
6. This will usually automatically open a web browser and launch the program. However, you can open it yourself if you go to "http://localhost:3000" in a browser.
